### Welcome!

Welcome to the Systems and Informatics Research Laboratory (SIRL) at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal. We work on applied societal research problems where sensing and analytics are leveraged to design and build tangible solutions. At large, our lab collects data in real-world settings with sensors, uses data to understand the problem dynamics, and builds data-driven scalable solutions in the form of robust and affordable systems. Currently, we focus on healthcare, transportation, and buildings
